        <section class="focus-group">
            <h3>Critical Minerals + Tariffs</h3>
            <div class="columns-container">
                <div class="column">
                    <h4>Negatives</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Chinese leverage over critical minerals:</strong> China’s dominant share of mining, refining, and new export controls gives it enduring leverage over rare earths and other inputs that nuclear-relevant systems require.</li>
                        <li><strong>Chokepoints in antimony and key metals:</strong> Export cuts, price spikes, and strained Western stockpiles for antimony and other dual-use metals expose munitions and critical components to disruptive supply shocks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tariffs and long transition window:</strong> Tariffs, resource nationalism, and a decade-plus timeline to diversify away from China keep semiconductor and critical mineral supply chains volatile and vulnerable.</li>
                    </ul>

                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <h4>Positives</h4>
                    <ul>
                       <li><strong>Allied minerals frameworks:</strong> Frameworks with Japan, Australia, Malaysia, Thailand, Central Asia, Brazil, the UAE and others explicitly target critical minerals for defense and clean energy, broadening trusted suppliers for the nuclear industrial base.</li>
                        <li><strong>Domestic mining and processing buildout:</strong> New U.S. projects in antimony, rare earth separation and metallization, mine-to-magnet chains, and enabling infrastructure such as the Ambler Road are rebuilding critical capacity onshore.</li>
                        <li><strong>Strategic finance and stockpiles:</strong> DoD, EXIM, Commerce, USGS-guided programs and private capital are funding stockpiles, magnet plants and rare earth projects that backstop defense and semiconductor supply chains.</li>
                        <li><strong>Policy alignment on criticality:</strong> The expanded U.S. critical minerals list and targeted regulatory relief for mining and processing facilities align permitting and federal investment with long-term industrial base resilience.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h3>Microelectronics</h3>
            <div class="columns-container">
                <div class="column">
                    <h4>Negatives</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Weak U.S. chip production base:</strong> U.S. fabs now produce only a small share of global semiconductors, keeping nuclear command-and-control and support systems exposed to foreign manufacturing shocks and geopolitical pressure.</li>
                        <li><strong>Risks from export controls and decoupling:</strong> Tight export controls and shrinking access to the China market could erode U.S. chipmakers’ R&amp;D budgets even as China races for AI chip self-sufficiency, fragmenting supply chains and raising costs.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <h4>Positives</h4>
                    <ul>
                         <li><strong>High-performance computing expansion:</strong> DOE partnerships with AMD, Nvidia, and Oracle on new AI supercomputers significantly expand domestic modeling and simulation capacity that underpins nuclear analysis and design.</li>
                        <li><strong>Advanced fabs and processes in the U.S.:</strong> Blackwell chip and wafer production in Arizona, Intel’s 18A process for Microsoft’s Maia 2, and GlobalFoundries’ GaN ramp in Vermont shift key logic and power devices into U.S. manufacturing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Emerging tools and policy support:</strong> Novel X-ray lithography efforts, superconducting germanium research, and proposals like the GAIN AI Act all point toward more secure domestic chipmaking and priority access for national security missions.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h3>CFIUS + Domestic Production</h3>
            <div class="columns-container">
                <div class="column">
                    <h4>Negatives</h4>
                    <ul>
                                             <li><strong>Shutdown-driven CFIUS delays:</strong> The Hindalco–AluChem stall during the 2025 government shutdown shows how disruptions to CFIUS review can slow allied investment in upstream materials that feed semiconductor and industrial supply chains.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <h4>Positives</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Domestic enrichment capacity:</strong> GLE’s successful large-scale SILEX enrichment test in North Carolina is a major step toward domestic low-enriched uranium supply and reduced reliance on foreign fuel.</li>
                        <li><strong>Nuclear-grade additive manufacturing:</strong> The MANTRA hub collaboration on metal additive manufacturing for nuclear-grade materials can speed qualification of advanced parts and enable more secure, on-demand components for reactors and facilities.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h3>Toxic Chemicals</h3>
            <div class="columns-container">
                <div class="column">
                    <h4>Negatives</h4>
                    <ul>
                         <li><strong>PFAS and TSCA enforcement pressure:</strong> EPA’s aggressive PFAS and TSCA agenda raises compliance costs and operational uncertainty for NIB-relevant facilities that depend on regulated chemicals in manufacturing and decontamination.</li>
                        <li><strong>EU PFAS and SVHC tightening:</strong> New EU PFAS restrictions and SVHC listings increase reporting and redesign burdens for electronics and materials suppliers that support the nuclear industrial base, with potential delays and cost increases.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fragmented chemical regimes:</strong> Diverging U.S. and EU approaches to toxic chemicals create regulatory whiplash that complicates cross-border sourcing and can store up future liability at defense-adjacent sites.</li>

                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <h4>Positives</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Risk-based PFAS carve-outs:</strong> The EU move to a more risk-based PFAS regime with long transition periods and sector derogations preserves some critical industrial uses while giving suppliers time to plan substitutions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Support for data-center chemicals:</strong> TSCA prioritization and relief for certain data-center chemicals ease constraints on AI and high-performance computing buildout that nuclear programs increasingly rely on.</li>
                        <li><strong>Improved chemical risk management:</strong> Sustained focus on PFAS and other high-risk substances is pushing firms to map chemical use and invest in mitigation, ultimately supporting a cleaner and more resilient industrial base.</li>
